/**
 * Click handler behind the selection menu's "Move to Locked" action

 * `tj1` is a synthetic Function1 shared by several handlers and switches on its field `i`.
 * `i == 2` is the vault handler: it receives the selected media (a List of `np1`, the
 * "MediaImage" model) and launches the coroutine `if0`, which moves them into the hidden vault.
